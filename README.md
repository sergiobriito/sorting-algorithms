## Sorting Visualizer
This is a sorting visualizer web application that allows you to visualize different sorting algorithms in action. It generates a random array of numbers and animates the sorting process using bars to represent the values.

You can choose from various sorting algorithms using the dropdown menu. The available options are:

* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort

After selecting a sorting algorithm, click the "Execute" button to start the sorting process. The bars representing the array values will animate to demonstrate the sorting algorithm in action.

This app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the sorting visualizer.
